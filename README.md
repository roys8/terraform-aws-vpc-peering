aws\_vpc_peering terraform module
===========

A terraform module to provide a VPC peering from one VPC to another.

**Notes:**
- There must not be a CIDR block overlap between the two VPCs.
- Ensure that your VPCs have an appropriate "Name" tag as these are used to name the new VPC.
- Multi-region VPC Peering cannot be auto-accepted.


Module Input Variables
----------------------

- `peer_src_vpc_id`           - The VPC ID of the initiating VPC.
- `peer_dst_vpc_id`           - The VPC ID of the receiving VPC.
- `peer_src_route_tables`     - Route tables of the initiating VPC to add routes to the receiving VPC for.
- `peer_dst_route_tables` - Route tables of the receiving VPC to add routes to the initiating VPC for.
- `auto_accept`               - Specify whether or not this connection should automatically be accepted. Must be set to false if VPCs are not in the same region.
